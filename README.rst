This project presents a study of the aerodynamics of indoor model airplanes,
with the goal of predicting how long they will fly. The code presented here was
developed using notes written using Jupyter Notebook. The documentation found
at the link above is a static version of those notebook pages produced using
*Jupyter Book*.
